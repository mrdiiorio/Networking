This scheme of work has been designed as an introduction to networking on the Raspberry Pi. Students will set up and use various networks, and will be introduced to basic networking through practical activities.

This scheme of work is specifically targeted towards KS3 and KS4 Computing, although the first two lessons could be used at KS2. It has been developed in the context of the 2014 National Curriculum in England, but is not specific to that programme.

The scheme has been based on the work of David Whale, and the original content can be found below:
